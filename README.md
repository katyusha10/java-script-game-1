In this single-player game, you have to place map elements of different shapes and terrain types on an 11x11 square grid map. 
Each element is assigned a time value (1 or 2) and the game consists of 28 time units.
At the end (or during) of the game, a number of checks (missions) are performed against the current state of the grid, and the final score is calculated.
